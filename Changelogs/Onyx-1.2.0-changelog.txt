	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.15.2-1.4.3-60.jar --> pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.15.2-1.4.4-64.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.15.2-1.4.4-64.jar:
			1.4.4-64 (21 Aug 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#updates)Updates
			* Pneumatic Armor HUD now displays only 1 decimal place of pressure for armor pieces
			* - This is not just a cosmetic change, but part of an overall performance improvement with pressure sync'ing
			* - Previously sync'ing pressures of pneumatic items (including armor) was much too chatty in terms of server->client traffic
			* - Now only rounded air levels are sync'd to client, so the client generally knows item pressures with 0.1 bar of precision
			* - This is enough for the vast majority of display purposes; e.g. item pressure tooltips already display with 0.1 bar of precision
			* - Server->client traffic is now greatly reduced, especially for fast-changing pressures such as Jet Boots
			* When placing a Drone down, if the block clicked has no collision box (e.g. flower, crop, etc.) then place the Drone on the that block instead of the adjacent block
			* Drones (with the Pick up Items widget) will no longer "steal" items off Immersive Engineering conveyor belts
			* - Specifically, the widget now honours the "PreventRemoteMovement" entity tag
			* - This can be overridden via the widget's GUI when creating the drone program
			* Tweaked heat & air output of advanced compressors somewhat
			* - All compressors now produce heat proportional to the air produced (adding 1 heat per 20 air/tick produced)
			* - This affects the Flux Compressor in particular, which was producing much less heat per air than the Advanced Compressor & Advanced Liquid Compressor
			* - Flux Compressor now produces double the heat it used to, so yes: this can be considered a nerf!
			* - Heat generation will drop a bit as efficiency drops (since less air is being produced)
			* - Fixed issue where fractional amounts of air/tick were getting rounded down (so compressors may produce very slightly more now, depending on circumstances)
			* Reinforced Stone blocks are now a little easier to mine up (blast resistance has not been changed though)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes
			* Fixed Logistics Frames not being placeable on the Aerial Interface
			* Fixed client desync when placing items (e.g. torches) on a Pressure Chamber block from the offhand
			* Fixed (hopefully) an issue where client-side Logistics Frames would disappear on certain blocks
			* - This also caused a client-side crash if right-clicking a "missing" frame with the Logistics Configurator
			* Fixed Minigun item being rendered too far right in GUI context
			* Fixed occasional client-side crash with Block Tracker helmet upgrade enabled

	Productive Bees (productivebees-1.15.2-0.2.4.jar --> productivebees-1.15.2-0.2.5.1.jar):
		productivebees-1.15.2-0.2.5.1.jar:
			* Fixes a problem on some worlds where all bees output the same comb

		productivebees-1.15.2-0.2.5.jar:
			* Comb production has been limited to 1 per pollination. The comb will be deposited when the bees leaves the hive, just like honey. The amount of combs is still affected by the bees productivity level.
			* Added bee conversion from items recipe to JEI
			* New bee display in the hive and JEI

			* Updated comb colors
			* Updated bee egg colors for better consistency
